# Github-Actions

This repository is my personal playground for learning GitHub Actions and getting some hands-on experience.  

## Why This Repo Exists
I wanted a place to experiment with workflows, automation, and CI/CD pipelines without worrying about breaking anything. Here, I can test triggers, jobs, and custom actions safely.  

## What I'm Practicing
- Automating builds and tests  
- Running code checks on every commit or pull request  
- Playing with scheduled workflows  
- Trying out new actions from the GitHub Marketplace  

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo:
    
    ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
    ```

2. Explore or modify workflows in `.github/workflows/`.
3. Push your changes and watch GitHub Actions do its magic!
