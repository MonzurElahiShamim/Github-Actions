# GitHub Actions Learning Repository

This repository is my personal playground for learning GitHub Actions and experimenting with workflows, automation, and CI/CD pipelines. It contains practical examples and comprehensive documentation to help understand core GitHub Actions concepts.

üöß **Work in Progress**: This is an evolving learning journey! More advanced topics coming soon including full CI/CD pipelines, testing workflows, deployment strategies, and real-world automation examples.

## üìÅ What's Inside

### Workflows (`.github/workflows/`)
- **`hello-action.yaml`** - Demonstrates basic workflow structure, multi-job execution, manual triggers with inputs, and system information gathering
- **`env-variables.yaml`** - Shows environment variables usage at workflow, job, and step levels with built-in GitHub variables

### Documentation (`notes/`)
- **`triggers.md`** - Complete guide to GitHub Actions triggers (push, schedule, manual, webhooks)
- **`workflow-dispatch-inputs.md`** - Manual workflow triggers with different input types (string, boolean, choice, environment)
- **`environment-variables.md`** - Environment variables scoping, built-in variables, and dynamic creation

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Clone or fork this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MonzurElahiShamim/Github-Actions.git
   ```

2. **Explore the workflows** in `.github/workflows/` - each file demonstrates different concepts

3. **Try manual triggers** by going to the Actions tab and running workflows with different inputs

4. **Read the documentation** in `notes/` for detailed explanations and examples

## ‚ú® Key Concepts Covered

- **Workflow Structure**: Jobs, steps, runners, and dependencies
- **Triggers**: Push events, manual dispatch, and scheduled workflows  
- **Environment Variables**: Different scopes and built-in GitHub variables
- **Manual Workflows**: User inputs with validation and conditional logic
- **Multi-job Workflows**: Parallel execution and data sharing

## üéØ Learning Outcomes

After exploring this repository, you'll understand:
- How to create and structure GitHub Actions workflows
- Different ways to trigger workflows automatically or manually
- How to use environment variables effectively across different scopes
- How to create interactive workflows with user inputs
- Best practices for organizing workflows and documentation
